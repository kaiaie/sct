# sct - Set color temperature

This is a command-line utility for X Windows to set the color temperature of
your monitor (or monitors). If you are familiar with the
*[f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)* program, you know what this is. It requires
the XRandR extension to work.

This is *not* my code. It was written by Ted Unangst
[here](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/sct-set-color-temperature) and placed
in the public domain. I just added a Makefile and a workaround I found necessary
on my system to force the color temperature to change (I don't know whether this
is a Linux issue, an X issue or something to do with my video card).

Share and enjoy.
